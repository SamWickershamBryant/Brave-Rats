# Brave Rats #
Authors: Abigail Barrientos, Sam Bryant, Ethan Wintill, Laiba Janat, Selah Boyle

## Overview
Brave Rats is a quick, 2 player card game similar to war that is all about reading your opponent. Each player starts with 8 cards and puts one of them down to face the opponent. The card with the highest power usually wins, however each card has a special ability that greatly affects the outcome of the game. The first player to reach 4 victories wins the game.
We have implemented this game in to an online browser card game. Users can play private matches with their friends, or play against a bot to hone their skills.

The current version of the game is hosted at <a href="https://braverats.herokuapp.com/">braverats.herokuapp.com</a>

## Next Steps For Sprint 2

- ** Sam **:
	- For the upcoming sprint I will focus on starting my tasks as soon as possible to ensure that I am not waiting till the last minute
	- Before we begin sprint 2, I want to discuss with my team members the possibility of switching to a different project because the learning curve for our current project turned out to be very ambitious
	- As an improvement to the team's overall productivity, I will organize more team meetings in the Alkek library to ensure everyone is on the same page and making contributions
	- As far as improvements to the codebase itself, if we decide to stay with the current project, I will work on making the UI more pretty and responsive as well as more engaging for users.
- ** Selah **:
	- I will think more about my tasks and limit the scope of each task to make it more achievable in each sprint.
	- As a team decide on a different project or minimizing the scope of our current project to make it achievable with the amount of time and team member knowledge and ability.
	- Allow more time for research and learning curve for any new languages or technologies we decide to use.
- ** Abigail Barrientos **:
	- Figure out what portion of the code keeps the timer running when stop button is pressed
	- Edit code so that the user can change the time intervals
	- Start reasearch on how to implement pop up in app.
- ** Ethan Wintill **:
	- Before any more code is done, I want to decide with my group whether we will be switching projects, or greatly simplifying the current one.
	- Add functionality to connect the goal UI to the progress UI, if we stay on the same project.
	- Write a flowchart with my group showing the screen transitions we want at the end of the spring, something like this: https://www.google.com/url?sa=i&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.pinterest.com%2Fpin%2F297237644134196394%2F&psig=AOvVaw0l69g3FynIHYA8_-h3mVK5&ust=1679435111013000&source=images&cd=vfe&ved=0CA8QjRxqFwoTCJCi9L296_0CFQAAAAAdAAAAABAE
- ** Laiba **:
	- Starting Work way sooner and becoming more organized in handling my workload as I am dropping a class to decrease workload
	- Discuss Sam's idea of possibly changing project 
	- more organization and discussion including reasonable task devision to make sure we don't over estimate abilities to get tasks done as a team
	- for code starting sooner will allow me to lok more in detail in issues and find solutions and even come to teamamates sooner to help resolve and make progress

## Next Steps For Sprint 3

- ** Sam **:
	- For this next sprint I will add more features such as user logins and database functionality
	- I will work quickly to ensure that our goals are reached by the end of the sprint
Selah :
I will start and finish my tasks very early in the sprint.
Communicate with team members on what I'm currently doing.
Allow more time for merging and implementing team members code to work in sync with mine.
- ** Abigail Barrientos **:
	- For this sprint my task is to create a button in the main screen that allows the user to play with a bot. I will also be incharge of making the code for that bot.
	- Another task that I need to work on is giving the user the option to play with anyone who is currently searching for another player.
	-  The last thing I will need to work on for this sprint is allowing the user to select a profile picture in their account page.
- ** Ethan Wintill **:
	- I want to make sure I am still on the same page as the rest of my team, because I have a schedule conflict with our normal meetings. I plan on taking asking in the groupme when everyone's free and announce when I'm working in bing so anyone on campus can swing by.
- ** Laiba **:
	- Assigned 3 front end tasks 
	- do a multiple commits a day and 1 push atleast no matter how small the change 
	- more open communication about workload help if needed
